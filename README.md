<h2 align="left">How websites work</h2>

A website is like a book that you can read online using a web browser, such as Edge. The web browser acts as a client that requests information from a server, which is a computer that hosts the website. The client and the server communicate using HTTP, which stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP is a set of rules that define how messages are formatted and transmitted over the internet.

When you enter a website address, also known as a URL, which stands for Uniform Resource Locator, in your web browser, you are sending an HTTP request to the server. The server then processes your request and sends back an HTTP response, which contains the information you asked for, such as a web page or an image. The web page is made up of different files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, that tell the browser how to display the page. The browser then combines these files and shows you the website.

<h2 align="left">Http Requests & Http Responses</h2>

- HTTP requests and responses are messages between a client (web browser) and a server (web host) over the internet.
- HTTP requests tell the server what the client wants, such as a web page or data. They have a method, a URL, headers, and a body.
- HTTP responses tell the client how the server handled the request and what information it provides. They have a status code, headers, and a body.
- HTTP requests and responses enable the web to work by exchanging information and functionality.
